% For image reconstruction, first, the propagation path distance between the antenna and each focal point is computed and converted to a time delay, which is used to identify the contribution from each post-processed waveform.
% For irregularly shaped ore particle models, we need to know the location of a particleâ€™s edge in advance to know the proportion of air on a specific propagation path,
% thereby considering the propogation velocity in air into the calculation of time delay. Additionally, only the area inside the ore particle would be imaged.
% The contributions obtained from all antenna locations are summed,
% and then this sum is squared to acquire the voxel value at the synthetic focal point.
